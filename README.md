Project Sprint 3

Project Description:

As a data analyst, your job is to analyze data to extract valuable information and make decisions based on it. This involves different stages such as data overview, preprocessing, and hypothesis testing.
In the context of this project, you will test a hypothesis related to the musical preferences of two cities. This will be done by analyzing real online music streaming data to test the hypothesis below and compare the behavior of users in these two cities. This will involve analyzing actual online music streaming data to compare user behavior in Springfield and Shelbyville. 
The project is divided into three stages, each with specific objectives.
In stage 1, you will provide an overview of the data and record your observations. In stage 2, you will preprocess the data by cleaning it. Finally, in stage 3, you will test the hypothesis by following the programming steps necessary to test each statement and commenting on your results in the appropriate blocks. By completing these stages, you will be able to extract valuable insights from the data and make data-driven decisions.

Here is our hypothesis to accept or reject:The activity of users differs depending on the day of the week and depending on the city.
